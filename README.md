![Build status](https://travis-ci.com/grype/SwiftEthel.svg?branch=master)

Lightweight framework for composing web service clients in Pharo Smalltalk. It encourages to reason about web services in terms of logical structures, promotes clean and easy to maintain architecture, and provides helpful introspective tools.

Ethel has a simple architecture that is able to support a wide range of APIs, including REST and GraphQL.  It can be used to write complete SDKs of varying complexity and comes with a simple DSL that allows one to quickly script interactions with REST and REST-like services.
